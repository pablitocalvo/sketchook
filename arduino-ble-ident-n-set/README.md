# arduino-ble-ident-n-set
Arduino BLE module identification and setup sketch. 

Automatically identifies the module type, shows main settings and allows to change them.  
Supports HM-10, CC41-A, MLT-BT05 and similar generic BLE modules. Looking to add support for other BLE modules.

Supported modules identify themselves with the following keywords via the AT-command interface: www.jnhuamao.cn, HMSoft V540, HMSoft, www.bolutek.com, Firmware V3.0.6,Bluetooth V4.0 LE, BT05, MLT-BT05-V4.0, MLT-BT05-V4.1, MLT-BT05-V4.2, MLT-BT05, etc.
